# Software Statement

This software is designed to help the user accomplish larger goals
within a given framework through the development of routines and
budget tracking.

For instance, to be an author, a goal would be to write a book, a
milestone would be a chapter of the book, and the routine would be
writing 200 words a day - while having enough money for rent and
lunch.
